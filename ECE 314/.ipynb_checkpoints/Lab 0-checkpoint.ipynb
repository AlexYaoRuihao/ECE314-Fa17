At this point in your academic careers you should have some knowledge of object oriented computer programming. It would certainly help if you've had experience with Python, but if not, have no fear. Python is a very intuitive programming language. If you've coded in C#, JAVA, or Matlab you should have no trouble learning Python. Before we get too far into the code, we present a few general notions of what the environment will look like."

We also assume the notebooks are run using Python version 2.7XX rather than version 3.4XX.  For more information on installation or using an engineering work station (EWS) Linux machine, see instructions on the course webpage. An IPython Notebook file (with extension .ipynb) is an accumulation of cells, each composed of either code or markdown (i.e., text). Each code cell is individually executable. Each markdown cell can contain (among many things) LaTex and HTML.   Throughout each lab you will be shown examples of code, probability theory, and coding applications. *You will need to be able modify this file to include your own answers and edits. Each of the questions is numbered in bold and we ask that you put all your responses/code in cells just after the stated questions.  Let's go over some of the basics:</p>\n",

To run the cell that is the current focus you can press the play button in the toolbar or use the shortcut SHIFT-ENTER. You will notice it brings the focus to the next cell after it completes. To run and keep focus in the same cell, you can use CTRL-ENTER. The order the cells run in can be important. In these labs the order will always go from top to bottom. In order to run code in the middle of the lab you may need to have run the code in a cell prior to it.&nbsp;</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "            \t<strong>Stopping a Cell:</strong>There may come times when a particular section of code is causing errors or running an infinite loop. You may need to interrupt the cell from running. To do this simply click the stop button in the toolbar or use the shortcut CTRL-C</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Creating a Cell:</strong> A new cell can be created using the Insert tab at the top of the page. It will default to be a code type. You can change the cell type of any cell by clicking on it and then using the Cell tab at the top of the page. For normal text, use the &quot;markdown&quot; type. It allows you to use HTML and LaTex as well.</li>\n",

    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Saving Your File:</strong> There is an autosave that can be set to save your file at a given rate (default is to save once every two minutes). If you prefer saving on your own you can use the File tab or the CTRL-S shortcut. A handy feature, also under the File tab, is that you can revert to a previous saved checkpoint.</li>\n",
    "\t\t\t<li>\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<strong>Keyboard Shortcuts:</strong> It can be useful to learn the keyboard shortcuts for these. They allow you to insert cells, run code, clear code, at a much quicker a pace.

    "The scipy stats package contains a number of functions for using and analyzing distributions.  Two of its classes are rv_discrete and rv_continous, for discrete type and for continuous type distributions, respectively.   A discrete probability distribution is specified by a set of possible values, $c_1,c_2, \\ldots $ and associated probabilities for the values, $p_1, p_2, \\ldots $ which sum to one.  The probability mass function $p$ is defined by $p(c_i)=p_i$ for all $i,$  and $p(c)=0$ for values $c$ not in the  list of possible values.   A random variable $X$ has such a discrete distribution if $P\\{X = u\\} = p(u)$ for all $u.$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several important families of discrete probability distributions that frequently arise in applications.\n",
    "A very basic example is the Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p,$  where $0\\leq p \\leq 1.$\n",
    "The distribution assigns probability $p$ to value 1, and probability $1-p$ to value 0. If a random variable $X$ has the\n",
    "Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$, we call $X$ a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p,$ and we write\n",
    "$X \\sim Bernoulli(p).$   For example, if $X \\sim Bernoulli(\\frac{1}{4}),$ then $P\\{X = 1\\}=\\frac{1}{4}$ and\n",
    "$P\\{X = 0\\}=1-\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.  There is zero probability that $X$ is any value other than $1$ or $0$.  The class rv_discrete within the scipy stats package is for working with general discrete type random variables, with many instances of the class corresponding to particular well known probability distribuions.  It gives a convenient way to compute the mean, variance, pmf, and other attributes for a given distribution, and for generating random variates, using random number generators, with the given distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one instance of the rv_discrete class is the object for the bernoulli distribution.  By specifying (aka freezing) a value for the parameter $p$ we create a more specialized instance of a rv_discrete class.  The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable $X$ is the function $F_X$ defined by $F_X(c)=P\\{X\\leq c\\}$ for any real value of $c.$   The CDF for the\n",
