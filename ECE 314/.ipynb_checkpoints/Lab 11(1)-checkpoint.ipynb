Internally, the numerical method will often use a much finer grid of time points to solve the ode -- but that is none of your concern.

The basic idea is that if the current population is [n[0], n[1]] then the drift (i.e. the expected rate of increase) of n[0] is n[0]  multiplied by the expected number of small crickets generated by a small cricket if an encounter happens.  That is true because each of the existing small crikets is having encounters at expected rate one.   To calculate the mean number of new small crickets generated by the encounter of a small cricket with a randomly selected other cricket, we use the law of total probability.  The encountered cricket is type zero with probabiity n[0]/(n[0]+n[1]), which results in F[0,0] new crickets of type zero, and the encountered cricket is type one with probability n[1]/(n[0]+n[1]), which results in F[0,1] new crickets of type zero.
